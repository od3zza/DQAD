# DQAD

**DQAD** is a collection of 15 digital artworks by **[od3zza](https://github.com/od3zza)**, created using digital photography and *JavaScript*. The stylization process was done in a static application, also available on this website.

> We live in a time when we only accept art — especially photography — if it's top quality. If it's not that cool, grainy old-school photo, we just think it's trash... or, at best, it turns into a super-compressed meme that the internet goes wild sharing. DQAD is my way of messing things up a bit. It's an experiment in destruction. Or reconstruction. Call it what you like. Taking some of my own original photos from various themes, photos I took myself, I condemned them to extreme pixelation. It's an art of the absurd, and purely digital. Here, these images get a new life. They're reconfigured using a 'language' of fragmentation and heavy compression, a mix of everything with the very code of this simple, somewhat static app — but it gets the job done. The result is completely new images that make up this series. For me, this experiment is part of a development study, also a practice of re-signification, a reflection on art, and an exploration of new avenues for dialogue between the eye and technology... and curiosity.
